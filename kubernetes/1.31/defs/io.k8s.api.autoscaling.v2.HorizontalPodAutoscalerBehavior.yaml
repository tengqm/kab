description: Configuration of the scaling behavior of the target in both up and down
  directions (`scaleUp` and `scaleDown` fields respectively).
properties:
  scaleDown:
    $ref: '#/definitions/io.k8s.api.autoscaling.v2.HPAScalingRules'
    description: The scaling policy for scaling down. If not set, the default value
      is to allow to scale down to `minReplicas` Pods, with a 300 second stabilization
      window (i.e., the highest recommendation for the last 300sec is used).
  scaleUp:
    $ref: '#/definitions/io.k8s.api.autoscaling.v2.HPAScalingRules'
    description: "The scaling policy for scaling Up. If not set, the default value
      is the higher of:\n\n1. increase no more than 4 Pods per 60 seconds;\n1. double
      the number of Pods per 60 seconds.\n\nNo stabilization is used."
