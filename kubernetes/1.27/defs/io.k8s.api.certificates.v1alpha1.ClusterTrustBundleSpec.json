Its max length is 253 characters (DNS1123 subdomain limit).\n- `<namesapce>` is the namespace name for the resource. Its max length is 63 characters (as per limited by DNS1123 labels).\n- `<name>` is the resource name, which has a limit of 253 characters (DNS1123 subdomain limit).\n\nAdditional two characters are added to account for the one `.` and the one `/`.\n\nFor example, for the signer name `example.com/foo`, valid ClusterTrustBundle object names include `example.com:foo:abc` and `example.com:foo:v1`.\n\nIf `signerName` is empty, then the ClusterTrustBundle object's name must not have such a prefix.\n\nList/watch requests for ClusterTrustBundles can filter on this field using a `spec.signerName=NAME` field selector.",
