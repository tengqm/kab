  This specifies how to handle requests that are subject to limits. It addresses two issues:
  - How are requests for this priority level limited?
  - What should be done with requests that exceed the limit?

  此结构用来配置如何处理收到限制的请求。主要用来解决两个问题：

  - 当前优先级别下的请求是如何被限制的？
  - 超出限制时，应该怎样处理请求？

properties:
  borrowingLimitPercent:
    description: |
      This field, if present, configures a limit on how many seats this priority level can borrow
      from other priority levels.
      The limit is known as this level's BorrowingConcurrencyLimit (BorrowingCL) and is a limit
      on the total number of seats that this level may borrow at any one time.
      This field holds the ratio of that limit to the level's nominal concurrency limit.
      When this field is non-nil, it must hold a non-negative integer.

      The value of this field can be more than 100, implying that this priority level can borrow
      a number of seats that is greater than its own nominal concurrency limit (NominalCL).
      When this field is left `nil`, the limit is effectively infinite.

      此字段如果被设置，则用来配置当前优先级别可以从其他优先级别借用的席位数。
      字段值是基于当前优先级别的名义并发度限制的百分比。
      此字段值非空时，必须为非负整数。例如当前优先级别的名义并发度限制为 200，当此值为 30 时，
      当前优先级别可以从其他级别借用的席位为 200 * 30 / 100 = 60.

      字段值大于 100 是允许的。当此字段未设置时，意味着可以借用的席位数不受限制。
    format: int32
    type: integer
  lendablePercent:
    description: |
      `lendablePercent` prescribes the fraction of the level's NominalCL that can be borrowed
      by other priority levels. The value of this field must be between 0 and 100, inclusive,
      and it defaults to 0.
    x-kab-description-zh: |
      此字段设置当前优先级别的名义并发度限制中，有多大比例的席位是可以借给其他优先级别使用的。
      字段值必须介于 0 和 100 之间，默认值为 0。
    format: int32
    type: integer
  limitResponse:
    $ref: '#/definitions/io.k8s.api.flowcontrol.v1beta3.LimitResponse'
    description: |
      This indicates what to do with requests that can not be executed right now.
    x-kab-description-zh: |
      此字段用来设置如何处理当前不能马上执行的请求。
  nominalConcurrencyShares:
    default: 30
    description: |
      `nominalConcurrencyShares` (NCS) contributes to the computation of the nominal
      concurrency limit (NominalCL) of this level.
      This is the number of execution seats available at this priority level.
      This is used both for requests dispatched from this priority level as well as
      requests dispatched from other priority levels borrowing seats from this level.
      The server's concurrency limit (ServerCL) is divided among the Limited priority
      levels in proportion to their NCS values.
      Bigger numbers mean a larger nominal concurrency limit, at the expense of every
      other Limited priority level.
    x-kab-description-zh: |
      `nominalConcurrencyShares` (NCS) 用来计算当前优先级别的名义并发限制。
      此值给出当前优先级别的执行席位个数，
      包括按此级别派发的请求以及按其他从此级别借用席位的级别派发的请求。
      服务器的并发度限制根据各个级别的 NCS 值按比例分配。
      数值越大，代表其名义并发度限制值越大，对其他级别的影响也越大。
