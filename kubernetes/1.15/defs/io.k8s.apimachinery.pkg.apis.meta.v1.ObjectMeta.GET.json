This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the `finalizers` list is empty. As long as the `finalizers` list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the `deletionTimestamp` is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.\n\nFor example, a user may request that a Pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the Containers in the Pod. After that 30 seconds, the kubelet will send a hard termination signal (`SIGKILL`) to the Container and after cleanup, remove the Pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.\n\nIf not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. `finalizers` is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
