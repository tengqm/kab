  "description": "This object is used to hold extensions in external versions. To use this, make a field which has `rawExtension` as its type in your external, versioned struct, and `object` in your internal struct. You also need to register your plugin types. Decode first uses JSON or YAML to unmarshal the serialized data into your external APIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object.",
