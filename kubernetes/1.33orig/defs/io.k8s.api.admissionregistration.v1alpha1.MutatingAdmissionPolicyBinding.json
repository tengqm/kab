  "description": "MutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds the MutatingAdmissionPolicy with parametrized resources. MutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding and the optional parameter resource together define how cluster administrators configure policies for clusters.\n\nFor a given admission request, each binding will cause its policy to be evaluated N times, where N is 1 for policies/bindings that don't use params, otherwise N is the number of parameters selected by the binding. Each evaluation is constrained by a [runtime cost budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/#runtime-cost-budget).\n\nAdding/removing policies, bindings, or params can not affect whether a given (policy, binding, param) combination is within its own CEL budget.",
