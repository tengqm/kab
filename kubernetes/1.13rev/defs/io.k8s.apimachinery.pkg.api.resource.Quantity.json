  "description": "A fixed-point representation of a number. No quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized. Before serializing, Quantity will be put in 'canonical form'. This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that no precision is lost, no fractional digits will be emitted, and the exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative. Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed.",
