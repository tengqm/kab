ACS must be a positive number. The server's concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) for each such priority level where the ACV means the number of requests that may be executing at a time:\n\n```\nACV(l) = ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )\n```\n\nBigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other PL).",
