  "description": "PodFailurePolicyOnExitCodesRequirement describes the requirement for handling a failed Pod based on its container exit codes. In particular, it lookups the `.state.terminated.exitCode` for each app container and init container status, represented by the `.status.containerStatuses` and `.status.initContainerStatuses` fields in the Pod status, respectively. Containers completed with success (exit code 0) are excluded from the requirement check.",
