An identifier is any identifier in the intersection of the `audiences` in the TokenReview's `spec` and the token's `audiences`. A client of the TokenReview API that sets the `spec.audiences` field should validate that a compatible audience identifier is returned in the `status.audiences` field to ensure that the TokenReview server is audience aware. If a TokenReview returns an empty `status.audiences` field where `status.authenticated` is `\"true\"`, the token is valid against the audience of the Kubernetes API server.",
