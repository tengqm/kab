Matching is done on a path element by element basis. Path elements are the list of labels in the path split by the `'/'` separator. A request is a match for path *p* if every *p* is an element-wise prefix of *p* of the request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. `\"/foo/bar\"` matches `\"/foo/bar/baz\"`, but does not match `\"/foo/barbaz\"`).\n- `\"ImplementationSpecific\"`: Interpretation of the `path` matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate `pathType` or treat it identically to `\"Prefix\"` or `\"Exact\"` path types.\n\nImplementations are required to support all path types.",
