  "description": "CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued. Kubelets use this API to obtain:\n\n1. client certificates to authenticate to `kube-apiserver` (with the `signerName` set to `\"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet\"` ).\n1. serving certificates for TLS endpoints `kube-apiserver` can connect to securely (with the `signerName` set to `\"kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving\"`).\n\nThis API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to `kube-apiserver` (with the `signerName` set to `\"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client\"`), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.",
