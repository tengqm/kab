You can add your own type as well.\n\n- `Opaque` (default): arbitrary user-defined data.\n - `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`: a token that identifies a service acccount. This type requires that the `kubernetes.io/service-account.name` annotation set to an existing service account name and the `data.token` field set to the token content.\n - `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`: reserved for a serialized `~/.dockercfg` file. This key requires that the `data` field contains a `.dockercfg` key for the config content.\n - `kubernetes/dockerconfigjson`: reserved for serialized JSON data that follows the same format rulse as the `~/.docker/config.json` file. This key requires that the `data` field contains a `.dockerconfigjson` key for the config data.\n - `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`: a builtin type for storing credentials needed for basic authentication. This key requires the `data` field contains the `username` and `password` key for user name and password (or token) for authentication, respectively.\n - `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`: reserved for data used in SSH authentication. This key requires that the `data` field contains a `ssh-privatekey` key as the SSH credential to use.\n - `kubernetes.io/tls`: reserved to store information about a TLS client or server. It is primarily used with TLS termination of the Ingress resource, but may be used in other types. This key requires the settings of the `tls.key` and the `tls.crt` keys in the `data` field, although the server doesn't actually validate the contents.\n - `bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token`: reserved for tokens used during the bootstrap process for a node. It stores tokens used to sign well known ConfigMaps. This type of a Secret is usually created in the `kube-system` namespace and named as `bootstrap-token-<token-id>`. The Secret of this type has the following keys specified under `data`:\n\n    - `token_id`: A random 6 character string as the token identifier. Required.\n    - `token-secret`: A random 16 character string as the actual token secret. Required.\n    - `description`: A human-readable string that describes what the token is used for. Optional.\n    - `expiration`: An absolute UTC time using RFC3339 specifying when the token should be expired. Optional.\n    - `usage-bootstrap-<usage>`: A boolean flag  indicating additional usage for the bootstrap token.\n    - `auth-extra-groups`: A comma-separated list of group names that will be authenticated as in addition to `system:bootstrappers` group.\n\n",
