      "description": "pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is\n  done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the\n  list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a\n  match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the\n  request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring\n  of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar\n  matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).\n* ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to\n  the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType\n  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.\nImplementations are required to support all path types.\n\nPossible enum values:\n - `\"Exact\"` matches the URL path exactly and with case sensitivity.\n - `\"ImplementationSpecific\"` matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.\n - `\"Prefix\"` matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is case sensitive and done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers to the list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). If multiple matching paths exist in an Ingress spec, the longest matching path is given priority. Examples: - /foo/bar does not match requests to /foo/barbaz - /foo/bar matches request to /foo/bar and /foo/bar/baz - /foo and /foo/ both match requests to /foo and /foo/. If both paths are present in an Ingress spec, the longest matching path (/foo/) is given priority.",
