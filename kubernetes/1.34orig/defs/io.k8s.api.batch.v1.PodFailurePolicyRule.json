      "description": "Specifies the action taken on a pod failure when the requirements are satisfied. Possible values are:\n\n- FailJob: indicates that the pod's job is marked as Failed and all\n  running pods are terminated.\n- FailIndex: indicates that the pod's index is marked as Failed and will\n  not be restarted.\n- Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not\n  incremented and a replacement pod is created.\n- Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the\n  counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented.\nAdditional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.\n\nPossible enum values:\n - `\"Count\"` This is an action which might be taken on a pod failure - the pod failure is handled in the default way - the counter towards .backoffLimit, represented by the job's .status.failed field, is incremented.\n - `\"FailIndex\"` This is an action which might be taken on a pod failure - mark the Job's index as failed to avoid restarts within this index. This action can only be used when backoffLimitPerIndex is set.\n - `\"FailJob\"` This is an action which might be taken on a pod failure - mark the pod's job as Failed and terminate all running pods.\n - `\"Ignore\"` This is an action which might be taken on a pod failure - the counter towards .backoffLimit, represented by the job's .status.failed field, is not incremented and a replacement pod is created.",
