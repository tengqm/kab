This mode should be defined if the `fsGroup` is expected to always change on mount.\n- `\"None\"`: Volumes will be mounted without performing any ownership or permission modifications, as the CSIDriver does not support these operations. This mode should be selected if the CSIDriver does not support `fsGroup` modifications. For example, when Kubernetes cannot change ownership and permission on a volume due to root-squash settings on a NFS volume.\n- `\"ReadWriteOnceWithFSType\"`: Each volume will be examined to determine if the volume ownership and permissions should be modified. If a fstype is defined and the volume's access mode contains `\"ReadWriteOnce\"`, then the defined `fsGroup` will be applied. This mode should be defined if it's expected that the `fsGroup` may need to be modified depending on the Pod's security policy. This is the default behavior if no other policy is defined.\n\nThis field is Alpha-level, and is only honored by servers that enable the `CSIVolumeFSGroupPolicy` feature gate.\n\nThis field is immutable.",

It is only required for drivers which support both the `\"Persistent\"` and `\"Ephemeral\"` `volumeLifecycleMode`. Other drivers can leave Pod info disabled and/or ignore this field.
