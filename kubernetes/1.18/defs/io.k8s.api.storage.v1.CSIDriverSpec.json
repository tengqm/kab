      "description": "This indicates this CSI volume driver requires an `attach` operation (because it implements the CSI `ControllerPublishVolume()` method), and that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the `attach` volume interface which checks the `volumeattachment` status and waits until the volume is attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI 'external-attacher' coordinates with CSI volume driver and updates the `volumeattachment` status when the `attach` operation is complete. If the `CSIDriverRegistry` feature gate is enabled and the value is specified to `false`, the `attach` operation will be skipped. Otherwise the `attach` operation will be called.",

      "description": "If set to true, `podInfoOnMount` indicates this CSI volume driver requires additional Pod information (like `podName`, `podUID`, etc.) during `mount` operations. If set to false, Pod information will not be passed on `mount`. The CSI driver specifies `podInfoOnMount` as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will pass Pod information as `VolumeContext` in the CSI `NodePublishVolume()` calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and validating the information passed in as `VolumeContext`. The following `VolumeConext` will be passed if `podInfoOnMount` is set to true. This list might grow, but the prefix will be used. '`csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name'`: `pod.Name`; '`csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace`': `pod.Namespace`; '`csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid`': `string(pod.UID)`; '`csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral`': `true` iff the volume is an ephemeral inline volume defined by a `CSIVolumeSource`, otherwise `false`; '`csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral`' is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only required for drivers which support both the '`Persistent`' and '`Ephemeral`' VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave Pod info disabled and/or ignore this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.",

The default if the list is empty is '`Persistent`', which is the usage defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the usual PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is '`Ephemeral`'. In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside the Pod spec with `CSIVolumeSource` and their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of that Pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to get a `NodePublishVolume()` call for such a volume. For more information about implementing this mode, see https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html. A driver can support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future. This field is beta.",
