IPs are not allowed. Currently an entry in the `http` list can only apply to the IP in the `spec` of the parent Ingress.\n 2. The '`:`' delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. The port of an Ingress is implicitly 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.\n\nBoth may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the `host` before the `http`. If the `host` is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified `http` backend. The `host` string can contain '`*`'.",
