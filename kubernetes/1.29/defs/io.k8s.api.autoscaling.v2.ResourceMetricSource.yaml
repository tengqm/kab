description: A resource metric describing each Pod in the current scale target. The
  resource is known to Kubernetes as it can be specified in `requests` and `limits`.
  The values will be averaged together before being compared to the target. Such metrics
  are built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those available
  to normal per-Pod metrics using the `"pods"` source.  Only one `target` type should
  be set.
