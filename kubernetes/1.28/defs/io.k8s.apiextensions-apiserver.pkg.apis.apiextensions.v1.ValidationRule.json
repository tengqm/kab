      "description": "`fieldPath` represents the field path returned when the validation fails. It must be a relative JSON path (i.e. with array notation) scoped to the location of this `x-kubernetes-validations` extension in the schema and refer to an existing field. e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the `fieldPath` could be set to `.testMap.foo`. If the validation checks two lists must have unique attributes, the `fieldPath` could be set to either of the list: e.g. `.testList`. It does not support list numeric index. It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info. Numeric index of array is not supported. For field name which contains special characters, use `['specialName']` to refer the field name. e.g. for attribute `foo.34$` appears in a list `testList`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testList['foo.34$']`",

Since `messageExpression` is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string. If both `message` and `messageExpression` are present on a rule, then `messageExpression` will be used if validation fails. If `messageExpression` results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the `messageExpression` field were unset. If `messageExpression` evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the `messageExpression` field were unset, and the fact that `messageExpression` produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. `messageExpression` has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type. Example: \"x must be less than max (\"+string(self.max)+\")\"",

    "rule": {
      "description": "`rule` represents the expression which will be evaluated by [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec). The `rule` is scoped to the location of the `x-kubernetes-validations` extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example:\n\n- Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource:\n\n  ```\n{\"rule\": \"self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired\"}\n```\n\nIf the `rule` is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with `additionalProperties` (i.e. a map), the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`.\n\nIf the `rule` is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions.\n\nIf the `rule` is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples:\n\n- Rule scoped to a map of objects:\n\n```{\"rule\": \"self.components['Widget'].priority < 10\"}\n```\n\n- Rule scoped to a list of integers:\n\n```\n{\"rule\": \"self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)\"}\n```\n\n- Rule scoped to a string value:\n\n```\n{\"rule\": \"self.startsWith('kube')\"}\n```\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any `x-kubernetes-embedded-resource` annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nUnknown data preserved in custom resources via `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes:\n\n- Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields`.\n- Object properties where the property schema is of an \"unknown type\". An \"unknown type\" is recursively defined as:\n\n  - A schema with no type and `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` set to true\n  - An array where the items schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n  - An object where the `additionalProperties` schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression:\n\n- `__` escapes to `__underscores__`\n- `.` escapes to `__dot__`\n- `-` escapes to `__dash__`\n- `/` escapes to `__slash__`\n- Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to `__{keyword}__`. The keywords are:\n  \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",\n \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\".\n\nExamples:\n\n- Rule accessing a property named \"namespace\": `{\"rule\": \"self.__namespace__ > 0\"}`\n- Rule accessing a property named \"x-prop\": `{\"rule\": \"self.x__dash__prop > 0\"}`\n- Rule accessing a property named \"redact__d\": `{\"rule\": \"self.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}`\n\nEquality on arrays with `x-kubernetes-list-type` of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. `[1, 2] == [2, 1]`. Concatenation on arrays with `x-kubernetes-list-type` use the semantics of the list type:\n\n- `set`: `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.\n- `map`: `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.",
