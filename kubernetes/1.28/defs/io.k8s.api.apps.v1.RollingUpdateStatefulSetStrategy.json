Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This can not be 0. When specified as percentage, the value cannot be greater than 100%. Defaults to `1`. This field is Alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the `MaxUnavailableStatefulSet` feature. The field applies to all Pods in the range `0` to `replicas-1`. That means if there is any unavailable Pod in the range `0` to `replicas-1`, it will be counted towards `maxUnavailable`."
