Kubernetes may however choose to restart the container if it is unable to actuate resize without a restart. For example, the runtime doesn't support restart-free resizing.\n - `\"RestartContainer\"':Kubernetes will resize the container in-place by stopping and starting the container when new resources are applied. This is needed for legacy applications. For example. Java apps using the `-xmxN` flag which are unable to use resized memory without restarting.\n",
