      "description": "This specifies the action taken on a Pod failure when the requirements are satisfied. Possible values are:\n\n- \"FailJob\": indicates that the Pod's Job is marked as `Failed` and all running Pods are terminated.\n- \"FailIndex\": indicates that the Pod's index is marked as `Failed` and will not be restarted. This value is Alpha-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (disabled by default).\n- \"Ignore\": indicates that the counter towards the `.backoffLimit` is not incremented and a replacement Pod is created.\n- \"Count\": indicates that the Pod is handled in the default way - the counter towards the `.backoffLimit` is incremented.\n\nAdditional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.",
