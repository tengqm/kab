description: The specification of a horizontal Pod autoscaler (HPA).
properties:
  maxReplicas:
    description: Upper limit for the number of Pods that can be set by the autoscaler;
      cannot be smaller than `minReplicas`.
    format: int32
    minimum: 1
    type: integer
  minReplicas:
    default: 1
    description: The lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler
      can scale down. `minReplicas` is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate `HPAScaleToZero`
      is enabled and at least one `"Object"` or `"External"` metric is configured.
      Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  scaleTargetRef:
    $ref: '#/definitions/io.k8s.api.autoscaling.v1.CrossVersionObjectReference'
    description: Reference to scaled resource; horizontal Pod autoscaler will learn
      the current resource consumption and will set the desired number of Pods by
      using its `scale` subresource.
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage:
    description: Target average CPU utilization (represented as a percentage of requested
      CPU) over all the Pods; if not specified the default autoscaling policy will
      be used.
    format: int32
