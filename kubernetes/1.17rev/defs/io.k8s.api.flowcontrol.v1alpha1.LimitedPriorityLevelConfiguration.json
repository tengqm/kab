The server's concurrency limit is divided among the concurrency-controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the assured concurrency value, i.e. the number of requests that may be executing at a time. For each such priority level, `ACV(l) = ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )`. Larger values of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every other priority levels).",
