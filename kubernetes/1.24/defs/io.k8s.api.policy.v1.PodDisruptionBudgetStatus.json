The following are known values for the reason field (additional reasons could be added in the future):\n\n- \"SyncFailed\": The controller encountered an error and wasn't able to compute the number of allowed disruptions. Therefore no disruptions are allowed and the status of the condition will be False.\n- \"InsufficientPods\": The number of Pods are either at or below the number required by the PodDisruptionBudget. No disruptions are allowed and the status of the condition will be False.\n- \"SufficientPods\": There are more Pods than required by the PodDisruptionBudget. The condition will be `\"True\"`, and the number of allowed disruptions are provided by the `disruptionsAllowed` property.\n",
