## UIDs

A UID is a UUID generated by the Kubernetes system for uniquely identify an
object. The UUID is internally a 128 bit integer that is extremely unlikely to
collide across time and space and requires no central coordination.
Every object has a distinct UID during its whole lifecycle. The UUID
string format is standardized as ISO/IEC 9834-8 and as ITU-T X.667,
defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt" target="_blank">
RFC4222</a>.
